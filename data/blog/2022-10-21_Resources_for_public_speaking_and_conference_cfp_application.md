How do you find events to attend or speak at?

I often get asked that
and in this article I'll share the resources I use for CFP (Call for 
Papers / Proposals) application and public speaking at conferences.

I've been doing active public speaking for about 5 years now so some
of this feels very natural to me already and I have developed my own
mechanics of applying to conferences and submitting CFPs

## A CFP template

How to structure your CFP application is a very important aspect of 
submitting a proposal. It's not just about the content, but also about
how you structure it and how you present it.

[CFP Template](https://cfptemplate.com) by Colby Fayock is a way to
organize and DRY up submitting your conference proposals. Another
reference to is the following [open source GitHub repository](https://github.com/colbyfayock/cfptemplate.com)
it lives on if you want to contribute or customize even further.

## Conference tracking websites

There are dedicated websites that track events world-wide, as well
as their dates for open CFP applications. Some are very specific to 
an ecosystem or domain, such as JavaScript or DevOps, and others are
general lists.

The following are events and conference CFP listings you can track:
- [Papercall](https://www.papercall.io)
- [confs.tech](https://confs.tech)
- [SeeCFP](https://seecfp.com)
- [CFPLand](https://www.cfpland.com)
- [CallingAllPapers](https://callingallpapers.com)
- [FrontendFront CFP](https://frontendfront.com/conferences)
- [CodeAndTalk](https://codeandtalk.com/topics)
- [.NET Conferences](https://github.com/kristofferjalen/dotnetconferences)
- [CFP Time](https://www.cfptime.org/home)
- [Conf42](https://www.conf42.com)
- [developers.events](https://developers.events)
- [CFP.watch](https://cfp.watch/)

Some of the above are also available to consume as a newsletter,
such as SeeCFP, which makes it easier to receive new upcoming events
as a push.

Another website to call out is [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com)
which is a CFP platform, to actually manage the applications sent to
events and for event organizers to track, rate them, and so on. But,
it's also possible to browse through events once you register to the
Sessionize platform.

There are also open source GitHub repositories which track CFPs
that you can watch for updates:
- [https://github.com/telstrapurple/DevEvents](https://github.com/telstrapurple/DevEvents)
- [https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda](https://github.com/scraly/developers-conferences-agenda)
- [https://github.com/javaconferences/javaconferences.github.io](https://github.com/javaconferences/javaconferences.github.io)
- [https://github.com/frontendfront/front-end-conferences](https://github.com/frontendfront/front-end-conferences)

## CFP Twitter

Twitter is a great signal for open CFPs and generally speaking,
a good resource for tracking conferences.

Here are a few accounts and Twitter Lists worth mentioning:
- [TechDailyCFP](https://twitter.com/TechDailyCFP)
- [CallingAllPapers](https://twitter.com/callingallpaper) is the Twitter version of the website mentioned above
- [PHP CFPs](https://twitter.com/PhpCfps)
- [IT CFP List](https://twitter.com/ItCfpList)

## Developer Relations and Community newsletters

Another great resource of getting more familiar with Developer Relations
and all about developer Community management are newsletters that focus
on this domain explicitly.

These DevRel & Community newsletters also feature upcoming events, and
open CFPs before they close.
