During my military service (Army Reserves) last month I’ve met an old friend – Igor Grushko whose actually an artist and studying Architecture. I showed him  [daloRADIUS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/)  and asked him to design some logo drafts, needless to say, Igor has done an EXCELLENT job and I simply love his logos. Here are his original logo collections for [daloRADIUS](http://sourceforge.net/projects/daloradius/)
