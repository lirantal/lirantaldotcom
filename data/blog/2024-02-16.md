I'm building a side-project on Firebase and as it usually is
with overly abstracted platforms, the rudimentary things often get in the way.
This step-by-step code through is how I managed to get a Fastify
application to act as a Serverless Function on Firebase that is triggered upon
receiving an HTTP webhook from Lemon Squeezy.

This Firebase Functions webhooks case study teaches on solving the following:
- Using the Fastify web framework instead of vanilla JavaScript code for Firebase Functions
- Fastify doesn't provide access to the HTTP request's raw body
- Validating the HTTP webhook signature from Lemon Squeezy

## The Lemon Squeezy use-case

Lemon Squeezy is an online merchant store provider and a payment processor
and makes a good quick-to-get-running Gumroad and Stripe alternative for indiedevs.

In the project I'm building I needed to configure a webhook on Lemon Squeezy so
that any time an order gets processed I can update the database entry for the 
user and have a record for the plans they bought.

## The Firebase tech stack: Functions and Firestore

The backend tech stack on Firebase is a simple use of Firebase Functions with
a deployed HTTP function trigger that validates the signature of the incoming
HTTP webhook from Lemon Squeezy and create Firestore database entries with
the details of the order.

Instead of building on top of vanilla JavaScript for Firebase Functions, I 
choose to go with the Fastify framework for the following benefits:
- Better control over HTTP aspects such as adding CORS.
- All API endpoints reside in one codebase but provide a modular
microservice-oriented architecture with Fastify's plugin system.
- I like Fastify and it allows me to easily shift-and-lift in the 
future if I need to deploy this in a different infrastructure.

## Phase 1: Firebase Functions on Vanilla JavaScript

The following shows a working example of a Firebase Function called `lmswebhook`
that deploys under a route of similar name and it exports just this one function:

```javascript
// The Cloud Functions for Firebase SDK to create Cloud Functions and triggers.
const { logger } = require("firebase-functions");
const { onRequest } = require("firebase-functions/v2/https");

// The Firebase Admin SDK to access Firestore.
const { initializeApp } = require("firebase-admin/app");
const { getFirestore } = require("firebase-admin/firestore");

initializeApp();

exports.lmswebhook = onRequest(async (req, res) => {
  // capture the data coming from the HTTP request
  const requestData = req.body;

  // following is an example of some of the data that exists on
  // the Lemon Squeezy webhook:
  // const orderTransaction = {
  //   type: requestData.data.type,
  //   id: requestData.data.id,
  //   customer_id: requestData.data.customer_id,
  //   identifier: requestData.data.identifier,
  //   order_number: requestData.data.order_number,
  //   user_name: requestData.data.user_name,
  //   user_email: requestData.data.user_email,
  //   status: requestData.data.status,
  //   total: requestData.data.total,
  //   created_at: requestData.data.created_at,
  //   updated_at: requestData.data.updated_at,
  // };

  // @TODO you want to change this to whatever identifier you
  // pass in the webhook via the custom fields
  const uid = requestData.uid;
  // @TODO similarly if you want to use your own unique
  // plan or order identifier
  const planId = requestData.planId;

  // The following
  const orderId = requestData.data.id;
  const userEmail = requestData.data.user_email;

  const db = await getFirestore();

  // Construct the collection path
  const docRef = db
    .collection("users")
    .doc(uid)
    .collection("plans")
    .doc(planId);

  // Use a transaction to ensure atomic update
  await db.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
    // Get the document snapshot
    const doc = await transaction.get(docRef);

    // Create the document if it doesn't exist
    if (!doc.exists) {
      transaction.set(docRef, { orderId, userEmail });
    } else {
      // Update the document if it already exists
      transaction.update(docRef, { orderId, userEmail });
    }
  });

  return res.status(200).send();
});
```

You can access the Lemon Squeezy order data from the request body,
but notice that *there is no webhook signature verification code involved*
here, which means that literally anyone on the Internet can send you
HTTP requests that are fake and alter your data (⚠️).

You can deploy the function with Firebase tools CLI:

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions
```

## Phase 2: Use Fastify for the Firebase Function

Let's update the code snippet above to introduce Fastify as the library
that handles the HTTP request and reply and provides the foundational
web framework needs, such as:
- Adding CORS
- Configuring a request and response schema
- Routing middleware

Here is the revised version to include Fastify:

```javascript
// The Cloud Functions for Firebase SDK to create Cloud Functions and triggers.
const { logger } = require("firebase-functions");
const { onRequest } = require("firebase-functions/v2/https");

// The Firebase Admin SDK to access Firestore.
const { initializeApp } = require("firebase-admin/app");
const { getFirestore } = require("firebase-admin/firestore");

const fastify = require("fastify")({
  logger: true,
});

fastify.addContentTypeParser("application/json", {}, (req, body, done) => {
  done(null, body.body);
});

initializeApp();

fastify.post("/lms-webhook", async (request, reply) => {
  const requestData = request.body;

  // following is an example of some of the data that exists on
  // the Lemon Squeezy webhook:
  // const orderTransaction = {
  //   type: requestData.data.type,
  //   id: requestData.data.id,
  //   customer_id: requestData.data.customer_id,
  //   identifier: requestData.data.identifier,
  //   order_number: requestData.data.order_number,
  //   user_name: requestData.data.user_name,
  //   user_email: requestData.data.user_email,
  //   status: requestData.data.status,
  //   total: requestData.data.total,
  //   created_at: requestData.data.created_at,
  //   updated_at: requestData.data.updated_at,
  // };

  // @TODO you want to change this to whatever identifier you
  // pass in the webhook via the custom fields
  const uid = requestData.uid;
  // @TODO similarly if you want to use your own unique
  // plan or order identifier
  const planId = requestData.planId;

  // The following
  const orderId = requestData.data.id;
  const userEmail = requestData.data.user_email;

  const db = await getFirestore();

  // Construct the collection path
  const docRef = db
    .collection("users")
    .doc(uid)
    .collection("plans")
    .doc(planId);

  // Use a transaction to ensure atomic update
  await db.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
    // Get the document snapshot
    const doc = await transaction.get(docRef);

    // Create the document if it doesn't exist
    if (!doc.exists) {
      transaction.set(docRef, { orderId, userEmail });
    } else {
      // Update the document if it already exists
      transaction.update(docRef, { orderId, userEmail });
    }
  });

  return reply.code(200).send();
});

const fastifyApp = async (request, reply) => {
  await fastify.ready();
  fastify.server.emit("request", request, reply);
};

exports.app = onRequest(fastifyApp);
```

Let's break this code down for the Fastify parts that make it up.

We begin by requiring Fastify and initializing it with a logger default:

```javascript
const fastify = require("fastify")({
  logger: true,
});
```

Then, we tell Fastify that it doesn't need to parse the HTTP request's
raw data by calling the `addContentTypeParser()` function, and all we do
is call the `done` callback function with `payload.body` because that
`body` property is already in JSON format.

Why do we need to do that? the HTTP layer of Firebase Functions already
parses the raw HTTP requests payload based on the content type and provides
the already-parsed JSON data. So we explicitly tell Fastify here that it
doesn't need to do any special parsing of its own:


```javascript
fastify.addContentTypeParser("application/json", {}, (req, payload, done) => {
  done(null, payload.body);
});
```

Next up is our POST endpoint API route definition which should be a very
familiar and straightforward example for you:

```javascript
fastify.post("/lms-webhook", async (request, reply) => {
    // ...
    return reply.code(200).send();
});
```

Then we continue to the stock code of working with Fastify. It is a good
convention with Fastify to wait until all plugins have finished loading,
so we call `fastify.read()` and wait for the promise to resolve.

Usually, we would return the Fastify app instance (which itself, is a plugin,
how cool?), but in this case on Firebase there's no way for Fastify to bind
to an IP address on a network interface. So how do we do it?

We use `fastify.server.emit()` to emulate an HTTP request that originates
from the lower levels of Firebase Functions and push that to Fastify's own
HTTP request handling layer.

All of this put together looks as follows:

```javascript
const fastifyApp = async (request, reply) => {
  await fastify.ready();
  fastify.server.emit("request", request, reply);
};
```

Finally, we export a Firebase Function called `app` and we wrap the Fastify
app with Firebase's own `onRequest()` function which handles all the HTTP 
stuff for us:

```javascript
exports.app = onRequest(fastifyApp);
```

## Phase 3: Validating the HTTP webhook from Lemon Squeezy

You'd think that validating the incoming HTTP webhook from Lemon Squeezy
servers would be a straight-forward thing to do, huh?

The crux of the problem is the following:
- For performance reasons, Fastify does one of two things only: it either parses
the JSON and serves that to the routes on the request object, or it leaves it
in its raw form for you to handle that (just like we added our own JSON parser, remember?)
- The Firebase layer only provides the JSON parsed data. However, luckily for us,
they already solved that problem a while back and this isn't a problem anymore.

We address the raw body with a one-liner change:

```javascript
  fastify.addContentTypeParser("application/json", {}, (req, payload, done) => {
    req.rawBody = payload.rawBody;
    done(null, payload.body);
  });
```

The change is to update the previous function call for request parsing to use the 
payload that is passed from Firebase HTTP layer (`payload`) so that we save the 
`rawBody` on the request object.

This then allows us to access the raw body via `request.rawBody` in the route
handler so we can calculate the digest.

Validating the HTTP request webhook signature looks as follows:

```javascript
function validateWebhookRequest(request) {
  const secret = LEMON_SQUEEZY_WEBHOOK_SECRET;
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret);
  const digest = Buffer.from(
    hmac.update(request.rawBody).digest("hex"),
    "utf8"
  );
  const signature = Buffer.from(request.headers["x-signature"] || "", "utf8");

  if (!crypto.timingSafeEqual(digest, signature)) {
    throw new Error("Invalid signature.");
  }
}
```

In summary, there's a fully working code example in the following GitHub repository
